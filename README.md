This are my basic shell configurations.

Ensure you have installed ohmyzsh first.

In order to use this, clone this repository wherever you want and then run the
shell script init_settings.sh

This will symlink the files to the ohmyzsh configuration places.

ln -s chopi ~/.ohmyzsh/custom/plugins/chopi
ln -s .zshrc ~/.zshrc
